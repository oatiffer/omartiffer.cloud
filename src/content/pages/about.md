content: "I started my journey in tech back in 2008, fresh out of college, configuring Linux servers at the domain registry of my country (.ni). t was hands-on, challenging, and laid the foundation for a diverse career spanning a range of technical roles — from systems administration to enterprise virtualization, technical sales, frontend development, and data migrations.\n

Over the years I've worn many hats. I’ve worked with technologies like Netfilter/IPTables, Apache, Postfix, VMware, DellEMC, Cisco UCS, F5 Big-IP, React, Tailwind, Python, and more. My hands-on experience includes building infrastructure from scratch, designing, deploying, and supporting virtualization solutions, and creating responsive web apps. After relocating to the US, I began working on data migrations for customers adopting a legal SaaS platform, streamlining their onboarding by leveraging Python scripting, SQL, and API integrations.\n

My goal now? To fully transition into Cloud and DevOps engineering — bringing together years of infrastructure experience, programming knowledge, a drive for continuous learning, and a mindset for automation and scalability."
